The most exiting thing in the programming world is when you start to learn something and you move from theory to practice (well, that's describing myself a little) and you create your first **Hello world** and... it works! You feel like an hero ehh? Now imagine the "Hello world" does what it's supposed to do at the first try, WOW a god 😎.

Well, this post is my Hello world and not, it didn't work in my first try 😖, but that happens! I always say: *"if it works in the first try, something could be wrong"* 😂. 

I used [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon/)'s blog as template for this one, you know, don't reinvent the wheel, Thanks Dan 🙏🙏🙏

Ohh look a [link](/hello-world/) that goes to 😏 ...this same post

**Hello world** and... welcome!!! Really hope you like what you read here!
